# Connect4-Game-Simple-AI
A python console connect 4 game where the opponent is the computer that makes choices based on weighted decisions.
Currently, the game just runs on the python console with 0's, 1's, and 2's. 
0's are empty spaces, 1's are user spaces, 2's are computer spaces.
Admittedly, it is sore to the eyes so I am currently learning pygame to make the play more user friendly, that update may be out soon.

## Update
I have begun learning oygame to help with the visual aspect. Currently I have created the board and the placement of game pieces updates as the user chooses its spaces.
The user input still has to be done through the command prompt, this is something I need to work on.
